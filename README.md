# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project

## Introduction

This project explores the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in games using Tic-Tac-Toe as a case study. The project was created as part of an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) to understand the intricacies of programming AI for games and how different levels of AI complexity can impact player enjoyment and game difficulty.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several levels, each representing a different type of opponent:

1. **Player vs Player (Level 0)**
2. **Player vs Random AI (Level 1)**
3. **Player vs Smart AI (Level 2)**
4. **Player vs Minimax AI (Level 4) - Impossible Mode**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelAdio/TicTacToe_EPQ.git
    cd TicTacToe_EPQ
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

## Usage

1. run the .exe file from the repository and follow the instructions on screen.

## Project Details

### Player vs Player (Level 0)

A simple implementation where two players take turns to play the game.

### Player vs Random AI (Level 1)

The AI makes random moves, introducing an element of unpredictability.

### Player vs Smart AI (Level 2)

The AI uses basic strategy to try and win or block the player from winning.

### Player vs Minimax AI (Level 4)

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, ensuring the best possible move is made every time, making it a highly challenging opponent.

## Evaluation and Testing

The project includes various playthroughs and test cases to evaluate the performance and behavior of the different AI levels. The results show increasing difficulty and complexity with each level.
